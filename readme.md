# ReadMe #
This repository provides:
- the full KiCad project, including gerbers plotted to the specifications of JLCPCB
- a PDF of the schematic for those who do not use KiCad
- the Arduino code
- a PNG of the user manual like bellow

![Manual](Manual.png)

The gerbers, pdf schematic and firmware are not located under the code tab but can be downloaded in releases.

All of this documentation is free for you to use, all I ask is that no direct copies of this pedal are made for sale.

Thank you.
